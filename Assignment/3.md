2. What is the effect of vibration on the strength and durability of concrete? Explain the different types of vibrators.
3. Assuming that concrete is made from the correct ingredients and in the correct proportions, what other requirements must be met to ensure a durable structure, that is, a structure with long life?
4. Differentiate between volume batching and weigh batching. In concrete mix procedure which one is superior?
